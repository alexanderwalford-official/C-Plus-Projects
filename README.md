# C-Plus-Projects
Welcome to my repository where I'll be saving my C++ class files. You'll find the most basic examples; starting at the typical "Hello world!" program and moving all the way to other typical practices such as building calculators or even applications that may be useful.

## Contribution
I'm currently not looking for anyone to comit any of their own code to this repository; however I do welcome corrections in the form of comments or issues. The primary purpose of this repository is to teach myself how to code in C++, not for someone else to do it for me.

## To-Do
- [x] Simple calculator.
- [x] "Hello World"
- [x] Data Types
- [x] Structures
- [x] Getting & displaying user input.
- [x] Branchless methods.
- [ ] More, coming soon.
